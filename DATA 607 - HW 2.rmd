```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Introduction

For this assignment, I asked my friends and family to give me their input on six movies. This includes a sql file, in addition to the document. 

### Setup R and install packages

```{r}

library(RMySQL)

```

### Connecting to MySQL

```{r}

mydb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='data607', password='data607!', dbname='moviesdb', host='localhost')

```

### Run query to select data from database
```{r}

movieData <-dbGetQuery(mydb,"SELECT m.title, c.user_name, r.review, r.rating FROM movies m
INNER JOIN reviews r
ON m.id = r.v_id
INNER JOIN critics c
ON r.c_id = c.user_id;")

```


### Aggregate the data

```{r}

aggregate(rating ~ title, data = movieData, FUN=mean)

```
